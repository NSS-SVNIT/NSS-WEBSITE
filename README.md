# NSS-WEBSITE

## Running the Website

To run the NSS-WEBSITE, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd /path/to/project`.
3. Install the required dependencies: `yarn install` if Yarn is already installed.
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev` (or `yarn run dev` if Yarn is already installed).
5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:5173` to view the website.

That's it! You should now have the NSS-WEBSITE up and running locally on your machine.

## Installing Yarn

If you don't have Yarn installed on your machine, you can install it using npm by following these steps:

1. Check if Yarn is already installed by running the command `yarn --version` in your terminal or command prompt.
2. If Yarn is not installed, you can install it using npm by running the command `npm install --global yarn`.
3. After installing Yarn, you can proceed with the remaining steps mentioned above to run the NSS-WEBSITE.

That's it! You should now have Yarn installed on your machine and be able to run the NSS-WEBSITE locally.
